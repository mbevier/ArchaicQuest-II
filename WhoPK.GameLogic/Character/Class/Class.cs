             The road to such power is a hard, slow journey. Mages struggle more than other classes in melee combat
              because They spent years studying magic and how to hurl a ball of fire towards their opponent instead
               of training for physical combat. This makes mages relatively weak at the beginning of their training
                but this changes however when a they have mastered the arts of magic. Important attributes for Mages
