This project contains:
* The Web API that powers the Admin tool
* The Signalr game server
* The Web client

The first phase of this project is to complete the web API so the game content can be created

For the web api we need endpoints that allow the creation of these things:
* Items - In progress
* Mobs
* Mob Scripts (Responding to events, moving from a to b, other basic AI)
* NPC Dialogue
* Quests
* Skills
* Spells
* Races
* Classes
* World Building (Rooms / Areas)


Next will be building the game server with a basic functioning web client so players can create an account, make a Character and starting moving around and interacting with the game world that was created with the admin tool.

Finally, make the web client look great
